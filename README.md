# fish-kubectl-prompt

Based on https://github.com/Ladicle/fish-kubectl-prompt, just moved kube context to 1st line on the left prompt.  Right prompt looks cool but inconvenient for copy and paste shell outputs to somewhere.

## CUSTOMIZE

If you want to customize, override the following environment variables.

set KUBECTL_PROMPT_ICON "âŽˆ"
set KUBECTL_PROMPT_SEPARATOR "/"

## Install
